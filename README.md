# IThelp Ironman Search Engine IT邦鐵人賽文章搜尋引擎

## 💡 Motivation 動機

### 🔍 Search Engine 搜尋引擎

_Ithelp_ is one of the most popular software engineer knowledge platform for Taiwanese people,
also the biggest event called _Ironman_ that invite a lot of developer asked them deploy one post a day,
and keep doing that for 30 days.

A great articles which can help tons of developers,
but it's actually really hard to find the solution in this platform,
that why we consider to improve the search functionality and user experience.

We'll building search engine that focus on **providing useful information to the user** and **focus on good user experience**.

_IT邦幫忙_ 是台灣最有名的軟體工程知識平台之一，
其中每年最盛大的事件就是 _IT鐵人賽_，力邀眾多的工程師連發30天的文章。

一篇有用的文章可以幫助到成千上百的工程師，
但實際上是很難在IT幫上找到方案，
這就是我們主要要優化的問題 **搜尋功能** 跟 **用戶體驗**。

此專案致力於在打造出 **提供用戶有用的資訊** 且 **良好的使用者體驗** 的搜尋引擎。

### 📊 Trending Analyzing 趨勢分析

We also interesting the trending of industry,
but we couldn't found any reliable information in Taiwanese community,
at least there's no reliable data to prove that.

So another topic in this project is provide user **statistics by analyzing articles** on _IThelp_,
which may help developer understand the industry
and also provide some direction for educator and content creator.

我們也對產業趨勢有濃厚的興趣，
但我們很難在台灣的社群中找到有公信力的資訊，
至少沒有有公信力的資料佐證。

所以專案的另一個主題就是藉由分析 _IT邦_ 的文章提供 **統計資料**，
或許可以幫助開發者了解產業，
也能提供一些方向給教育者跟內容創作者。
